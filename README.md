> **"Cloud" means n8n Cloud:** the "Cloud" in this package's name refers to **n8n Cloud** (the hosted n8n platform at n8n.io) — this package is built with zero runtime dependencies so it can pass n8n's community-node verification and be installed on n8n Cloud. It has nothing to do with Hudu's own hosting — it talks to the same Hudu REST API whether your Hudu instance is self-hosted or Hudu-hosted.

> **API Compatibility:** This node is aligned with Hudu API version 2.44.0 (reference: `api-docs-v2.44.0.json` in this repository). Some features require specific API versions. Compatibility with future Hudu versions is not guaranteed without further updates.

> **Note — Hudu AI Tools not included in this edition:** the dedicated **Hudu AI Tools** node (the `HuduAiTools` supplyData tool / MCP Server Trigger tool) is **not** part of this package. For the full feature set, including that dedicated AI Tools node, see **[n8n-nodes-hudu](https://github.com/msoukhomlinov/n8n-nodes-hudu)** (self-hosted). This package, `n8n-nodes-hudu-cloud`, is the n8n Cloud–verifiable edition and still supports **AI Agent tool use** via the main **Hudu** node's `usableAsTool` capability — every resource/operation on the Hudu node is automatically exposed to AI agents, no separate node required.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.

## Credentials

To use this node, you need to:

1. Have a Hudu instance
2. Generate an API key in your Hudu settings
3. Configure the node with:
   - Base URL (e.g., https://your-hudu-instance.com)
   - API Key

## Features

- Comprehensive pagination support for applicable resources
- Robust error handling and debugging capabilities
- Advanced filtering options with both API-side and client-side filtering
- Support for both single and bulk operations
- Dynamic loading of related resources (companies, users, assets, layouts, networks, groups, VLANs, VLAN Zones)
- Date range filtering with preset options
- Automatic type conversion and validation
- Debug logging for troubleshooting (category-based; see DEBUG.md; requires N8N_LOG_LEVEL=debug when running n8n)
- Central request sanitisation (omits empty optionals to prevent API 500s)
- Resource-specific update collections across all resources
- Optional article markdown conversion (HTML to Markdown) for Articles get/get many (uses internal regex-based converter)
- Flexible identifier support: Get operations support both numeric IDs and slugs via Identifier Type toggle (Articles, Asset Layouts, Asset Passwords, Assets, Companies, Groups, Networks, Password Folders, Procedures, Users, VLAN Zones, VLANs, Websites)
- **AI Agent support**: the main `Hudu` node is `usableAsTool`, so every resource/operation can be used directly as an AI Agent tool without a separate node (compatible with Anthropic Claude, OpenAI, and other providers). For a dedicated Hudu AI Tools node with a unified per-resource tool model, see `n8n-nodes-hudu` (self-hosted)

## AI Agent Usage

The main **Hudu** node is `usableAsTool`, so it can be connected directly to an n8n **AI Agent** node — every resource and operation documented above is exposed to the agent automatically, with no separate tools node required. This works on n8n Cloud as well as self-hosted.

For a dedicated Hudu AI Tools node exposing a unified, per-resource tool model (one `hudu_{resource}` tool with an `operation` enum, structured error envelopes, `describeFields`/`help` introspection, etc.) — intended for advanced self-hosted AI Agent / MCP Server Trigger setups — see the separate **[n8n-nodes-hudu](https://github.com/msoukhomlinov/n8n-nodes-hudu)** package (self-hosted only). That package is not submitted for n8n Cloud verification.
